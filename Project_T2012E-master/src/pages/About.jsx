                      The life of an elevator usually falls between 10 and 15
                      years. Depending on the use and maintenance of the
                      elevator, the life of the elevator also changes. Regular
                      maintenance of elevators is usually 2 months.

                    <p>
                      This time may be less at the request of the homeowner and
                      according to the maintenance costs included in the
                      package. Small family elevators are usually used for
                      families, so few people use them. So the elevator will be
                      more durable. Usually less damaged after many years of
                      use.
